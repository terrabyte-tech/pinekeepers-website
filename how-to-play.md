# Pinekeepers Gameplay Guide

Playing Pinekeepers is simple, and odds are, you've played something similar before. Think Minesweeper, with trees and fire, but no instant death (though you still don't want to lose precious trees).

## Pieces to Know

### Trees

Trees are good in real life just as they are in the game. Players start with one tree sapling each game, but there is potential to uncover more trees as players clear more ash tiles.

__NOTE:__ Trees don't correlate directly to real tree saplings, but the more a player uncovers and saves, the more they plant in real life.

<br>

### Embers

Embers are the bad guys. Uncovering an ember tile means the surrounding area will be re-burned and re-randomized with a new ember.

<br>

### Water Buckets

Water buckets are the player's defense against embers. Water buckets can be placed on embers to put them out, or can be placed on trees to give them a (functional) one-time shield. But be careful! Players are given just 10 water buckets to use on potential ember tiles, and CAN'T be reclaimed once they are placed.

__NOTE:__ Tiles below water buckets ARE NOT re-randomized if the surrounding area is burned (even if it was an ember tile).

<br>

### Numbers

Number tiles give the player hints on where embers are hiding beneath the ash. Numbers left after clearing ash from a tile tell how many embers the tile borders. Embers can border a tile in any direction (including diagonally).

__IN SHORT: Trees are good, embers are bad, and water buckets are a finite resource you'll need to win.__

## How to Play

Each game, players will start out with a tree sapling in the middle of the board. The ring of tiles around it will be uncovered, giving the player the first hints of where the embers are.

## How to Win

The game is won only after all embers have been soaked by water buckets. All tiles may not need to be cleared to make this happen, meaning that clearing the board is not necessary to win.

As water buckets are a finite resource, running out of water buckets before putting out all embers will mean game over. The game will also end if the player burns their last uncovered tree.

__IN SHORT: Put out all the embers before running out of water buckets and all trees are burned.__

## How to _REALLY_ Win

The game is all about planting trees, aiming to make our world a little greener and to fight deforestation. While players are not required to clear the board in order to win the game, there are benefits to taking the time to do so. Additional trees may be hiding under ash tiles, giving the player more opportunity to save (and therefore, plant) more trees. 

__IN SHORT: Uncover the entire board, as additional tree saplings may be hiding under the ash.__
